## Exercise 22: What do you know so far?

* Create a file and execute it using Python3
* print - prints out strings in double or single quotes.
* \#  and """ - used for commenting out text, single lines and multiple lines
* Math operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus), <, >, <=, >=
* Order of operations (PEMDAS)
* variables - how to set them, how to add values to them, how to name them
* = vs. ==
* int vs. floats
* Format strings - use f inside a print function. This allows you to call (embed) variables within the string.
* round() - round function will round to nearest whole number
* print("string with a {}".format('string') - using format in this way feeds the string into the curly brackets. Similarly:
    * print("Its {} fleece {} was white as {}.".format('dumb', 'coat', 'snow'))
* end =' ' - it's a way to add a space at the end of an input function so that it doesn't return to the next line.
* variable = {} {}
    * You can do the same thing with format like this:
    * variable.format(1, 2)
    * variable, format("one", "two") etc.
* \ - an escape character. Can be used to add single quotes inside single quotes, or double quotes inside double quotes. Allows you to use \ characters in strings, like this \\
* \n - newline
* \t - tab
* \" - To escape a double quote
* \r - carriage return
* \000 - character with octal value
* \xhh - character with hex value hh
* input() - prompts user for input
    * variable = input("type something: ", end=' ')
    * prompts user for input and assigns it to a variable. The 'end' keeps it on the same line.
    * int(input()) - converts it to an integer
    * float(input()) - converts it to a float
* pydoc thing - lets you read documentation
